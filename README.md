# My Site

Server side rendered web apps with React, Express and Typescript. Pages are splitted into smaller bundles/chunks and has an option to prefetch on the server or let the client load. All async calls will be resolved before the whole app is send back to the client.


## TODO:
- API handling
- Database support
- Add maximum cache time for the async calls/data (or let the call be resolved everytime)
- Allow pages to be cached on the server (for less rerendering)
